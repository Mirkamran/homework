SSL offloading is the process of removing the SSL-based encryption from incoming traffic to avoid http server overload by 
processing burden of encrypting and decrypting data. 
SSL and its successor  TLS used for data encrypting across the Internet.
This protocols uses SSL handshake which consist of the several steps, both sites agreed on cipher suite, client side check server'server
certificate, after that both sides calcuate DH for key material. All this steps load CPU, and the main monitoring metric is going to be CPU unit
Depend on what kind of traffic we handle, there could be necessity for network monitoring in case of handling huge amount of data (video traffic)
Also we should add expiration metric date for SSL certificates, for avoid  using an expired certificate . In conclusion want to say first of all CPU and Certification exparation date
going to be monitored
