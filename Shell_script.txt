awk -v loop=10 -v multiply=10 'BEGIN{
  srand()
  do {
    numb = 1 + int(rand() * multiply)
    if (!(numb in array)) {
       print numb
       array[numb] = 1
       count++
    }
  } while (count<loop)
}'


For this task i decide to use awk because this give us much more flexibility when we work with data type

1)In the first line i decide we declare two varibles loop and multiply
  Loop shows us the lengt of our loop and multiply uses for  multipling random value rand() 
2) Rand function generate random, but if we want to have this randomity every time while we generate our shell script
   we have to use srand() function
3) On the third step we creating loop which will be break when 'count' will be equal to 10
4) Numb is equal to 1 + (randomly generated number between 0.0 and 0.9n and by multupling it to 10 we get fractional number,
 by using int() function transform it to integer value) 
5) On the next step we check is numb in  array, and if not we add this number to array and increase count by one
